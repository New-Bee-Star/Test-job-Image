#### Description
This project allows users to search data using Unsplash API.
I have used Grid view for this project.
Once you input keyword into the search box, you will get the list (30 items) of users.
If you reach bottom on the user list, the another users will be added.
If you tab the user, you will get it's photos.

The initial photos are random images from Unsplash.

To start the project:
npm install
npm start
